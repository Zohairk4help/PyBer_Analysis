# **PyBer_Analysis** 

## ***Overview of the analysis:***
The analysis includes in data computation on the factors: total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver and finding the total fare by the city types -- which are Rural, Urban and Suburban. The computation was performed to find the city type that has its largest contribution in ride-sharing in those factors stated above. 

## ***Results:***
![Fig1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89166130/135783748-f0d6c651-c727-4432-9f50-fa1c0516af8e.png)
Urban has the largest number of rides in the year of 2019. Rural has very least number of rides but with a very high rate of ride-cost!

Fig2 proves the number of rides in urban cities. Also, the average number of rides in the rural cities is about 4X-times lower per city than the urban and suburban cities, respectively.

Fig3 shows the ride fare data and that shows that rural areas has the highest ride fares that customer has to pay for their rides. From the combined box-and-whisker plots, we see that there are no outliers. However, the average fare for rides in the rural cities is about 11𝑎𝑛𝑑11and5 more per ride than the urban and suburban cities, respectively.

The figure 4 shows the drivers numbers are a greater in urban as compared to that of rural and suburban. The average number of drivers in rural cities is nine to four times less per city than in urban and suburban cities, respectively.

Fig5 supports fig4 and fig 1 that has the highest  rides, as well as fares, in urban areas as compared to rural cities that have highest price of rides but the number of rides were fewer than the other city types. 

![Fig8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89166130/135783756-3ec31f7f-be5e-4b38-98ab-2a720f9331ad.png)
Fig 8 backs all the previous figures. The line plot it shows has the time period starts with Jan through April 2019. the weekly line plot shows the relationship between the sum of fares and the date range. The plot shows that urban areas has its largest share in rides and its affiliated factors:  total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver and finding the total fare

## ***Summary:**** 
Dear Respected CEOs, based on the results, it is recommended that the introduction and opening of your internationally recognized business branch with its good quality products in the urban areas will be a prudential step. It is because of the huge inflow of customers at your business and this will be beneficial for the company’s revenue.
